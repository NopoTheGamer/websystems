- [x] You must link to the other 3 pages (past.html, future.html, comments.html) from the home page. You must as a minimum use HTML anchors for this, but can also add other navigation methods if you wish, for example, clickable images. You should also include links back to the home page from the sub-pages. Even better is a consistent navigation method such as a menu bar on all pages.

You are permitted to obfuscate your personal information in the index/past pages as we respect your rights to privacy.

past.html
- [ ] This page should describe your experiences with computing so far (eg: mention your HSC experience, past work experience).

future.html
- [ ] This page should describe what you want to do with computing in the future.

comments.html
This page is where the content, not only the execution, matters.  You are required to comment on :

- [ ] A short, personal reflection on your overall design
- [ ] The technical aspects of your website: eg: describe its structure, what CSS selectors/id's etc you used, and why (about half a page)
- [ ] The aesthetics of your website - eg: how users should perceive your pages and what effects you were trying to achieve (about half a page).
- [ ] An introduction to the aesthetics of Web design can be found here: http://alistapart.com/article/the-web-aestheticLinks to an external site. and at http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/Links to an external site.
- [ ] A quick guide to accessibility can be found at https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibilityLinks to an external site. and athttp://webaim.org/intro/Links to an external site.

websystems.css
- [ ] This shall contain all the CSS styles used by your website. 

- [ ] Do NOT use @import as the marking program will not detect this.
- [ ] You should try to make this web site as appealing as possible, using style sheets only.
- [ ] You will lose marks for embedded or inline styles.
- [ ] You must NOT use 3rd party CSS frameworks such as bootstrap, w3.css, foundation, etc..
- [ ] Your site should also be accessible to visually impaired users and screen readers (see comments.html accessibility requirements)

- [ ] make sure your files are in the websystems directory
- [ ] make sure all file names and href/src attributes are in lower-case.
- [ ] do NOT capitalise the first letter of filenames
- [ ] ensure files and directories have correct permissions!!
- [ ] unreadable or unusable web sites will also be penalised
- [ ] do NOT use deprecated tags or attributes. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html#Transitional_versus_strict for a list of deprecated tags and attributes.
- [ ] do NOT use frames or iframes (this causes problem for my validator/assignment checker)
- [ ] don't bother using CSS positioning or anything else not covered in lectures, labs or tutorials, there is no need
- [ ] do not make pages so wide that they can't be read unless you scroll horizontally
- [ ] you MUST test your web site with graphics and Javascript turned off. Is it still usable?
- [ ] you SHOULD check your web site on at two of the browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari and/or Microsoft Edge
- [ ] you SHOULD check your website using a mobile device
- [ ] watch out for large JPG from cameras - use a tool to reduce the size e.g. Microsoft Paint or Photoshop or GIMP
- [ ] do not use BMP or TIF files - these are'nt web friendly
- [ ] but do NOT rely on the Ed web preview function for final testing!  you must submit versions via Check and later Mark early to allow yourself time to address any issues that become apparent when the page is `live' - you may need several iterations to fix all errors.  Don't submit first, then only notice errors after the deadline !!
