		<h1>Past</h1>
		<h2>Experience with computers</h2>
		<p>I am highly expereinced with both Windows and Linux, and I also have some experience with Macos (it being unix based helps).
			I used Arch Linux for about a year and a half, at first I made the swap just to try something new but I kept using it because it works much better than windows with less random issues and no bloatware.
			Unfortunately due to software incompatibility I have moved back to windows and I just have to suffer with its shortcomings.
			I have been tinkering with computers ever since I was around 10 when I installed a virus onto my laptop in an attempt to get free gems in an online game.

		<h2>Linux and Web Systems (and Macos)</h2>
		<p>In my time using Linux, I had basically already learnt what the Ed lessons for Web Systems is teaching us. 
			I was using vim to edit basic files, and for a little bit in high school I used vim even to take notes in class however I soon realised this was not a great idea.
			I also have experience with bash and bash scripting as I made a few bash scripts to improve my productivity on Linux. 
			Using these skills I was able to easily finish all of the Ed lessons (besides the html and css one) before even attending class.
			Both Linix and Macos are based on Unix, which specifies how command line applications and the file system should be setup.
			Due to this I can use the exact same terminal, bash scripts and vim setup between my Linux home computer and my Mac laptop.
