            I'm not entirely sure what exact field of IT I want to go into but I am pretty sure it would involve developing software solutions. 
            I haven't thought about whether front end or back end development is more appealing to me but I am leaning towards back end development as I enjoy the problem solving aspect of it.
            I am also interested in cyber security and I am currently considering taking it as my major.

            I don't think web development is for me as html and css are quite messy in comparison to regular programming languages.
            However I think learning the basics of web development is important for any programmer as it is both useful for expanding knowledge and as a utility that can be used in the future.
