            This page is for comments and an explanation on why I used different parts of html and css to design my website
        </p>
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            I have used <code>alt="image description"</code> tags inside of my image tags to make my website more accessible to people who are visually impaired. 
            This is important as it allows screen readers to describe the images to the user.
            I have also used a simple colour scheme to make my website easier to navigate and read and to reduce any potential confusion.
            The table under this has a green tint for every second row to make it easier to read and to distinguish between where the rows end.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical aspects</h2>
        <table id="tableid">
            <tr>

                 I use these classes to: set the cat photos to a fixed size, 
                 Change the background and text colour of the header, 
                 Set the text colour and background colour of the navigation bar both when it's the selected page and when the button is being hovered over, 
                 Alter the style of my subject list to remove the bullet points

          </table>
          <p>
            I have altered the styling of a number of default html tags to provide a more visually appealing website. These include:
            <ul>
                <li><a>body: remove padding so that the header hits the edge of the page</a></li> 
                <li><a>span: I change every span to be the colour blue, this is bad practice however I only use one colour for my span so it's fine in this case</a></li>
                <li><a>tr(Table Row): I use "nth-child(even)" to set every other rows background to green and "hover" to make the row blue when the mouse is over it</a></li>
                <li><a>p(Paragraph) and h2(Heading 2): I just set a margin of a few pixels from the left</a></li>
                <li><a>div: Aligns the title and buttons to the center of the box</a></li>
                <li><a>h1(Heading 1): Center the title of the page</a></li>
                <li><a>ul(Unordered List) inside of a nav: Remove the list style e.g. the dot in front, center it on the page and make it so they are in a row instead of top down</a></li>  
                <li><a>li(List Item) in a ul(Unordered List) inside of a nav: set a margin from the right so the buttons have some spacing</a></li>
                <li><a>a(anchor) in the li(List Item) in a ul(Unordered List) inside of a nav: Provides a hyperlink to the other pages on the site</a></li>
                <li><a>footer: Set the footers background colour, text colour, width of the whole screen, and height</a></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
          <p>
                I have used a simple colour scheme of black, white, grey and blue to make my website look clean and professional as well as having a splash of personality.
                <br></br>
                I have used a relatively simple layout with a header and a body to make my website easy to navigate and read.
                <br></br>
                The navigation bar is aqua to provide a pop of colour as well as drawing the readers attention so they are aware of the other pages.
                The navigation bar also has a hover effect to make it more interactive and to make it clear that it is a button.
                <br></br>
                Text in the body has been subtly given a small margin to make the text easier to read and to give it a small indent from the title.
                <br></br>
                The images are all the same size and are lined up to show all 4 in a row on my screen but on a smaller sized screen they show in more of a grid pattern/under each other.
                The cats are also cuties.
                <br></br>
                The table that is on this page is styled to have a green tint as well as having a blueish tint when you hover over a row to make it more interactive and to provide a splash of colour.
                <br></br>
                The footer is a purple colour that provides contrast to the rest of the screen
